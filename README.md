# CS-320-Final
This repository is part of my coursework for CS 320, where I document and showcase my proficiency in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. It serves as a portfolio of selected works demonstrating my abilities to create robust unit tests and apply critical testing strategies to ensure software functionality and security.



**CS 320 Project One: Comprehensive Backend Services for Mobile Application**

This repository contains the complete suite of backend services developed for a mobile application as part of CS 320. The primary goal was to demonstrate the mastery of unit testing to uncover and correct errors in the application's backend, ensuring each component functions correctly and meets the specified requirements.

### Project Overview

In this project, I worked as a software engineer for Grand Strand Systems, tasked with developing backend services for a customer's mobile application. This included the creation and rigorous testing of contact, task, and appointment services to add, update, and delete respective objects within the application without any UI components.

### Repository Contents

- **Contact Service**:
  - `Contact.java`: Defines the contact object with fields like ID, name, phone, and address.
  - `ContactService.java`: Manages contact objects allowing operations like add, update, and delete.
  - `ContactTest.java` and `ContactServiceTest.java`: Contains JUnit tests verifying the functionality and constraints of the contact service and object.

- **Task Service**:
  - `Task.java`: Defines the task object with attributes like task ID, name, and description.
  - `TaskService.java`: Handles operations on task objects.
  - `TaskTest.java` and `TaskServiceTest.java`: Provides JUnit tests for verifying the task service functionality.

- **Appointment Service**:
  - `Appointment.java`: Encapsulates the appointment object with details such as appointment ID, date, and description.
  - `AppointmentService.java`: Manages appointment scheduling and deletions.
  - `AppointmentTest.java` and `AppointmentServiceTest.java`: Contains tests to ensure the appointment service meets all requirements.

### Key Learnings and Reflections

- **Ensuring Functional and Secure Code**: By implementing thorough unit tests and achieving over 80% test coverage, I ensured that all services are not only functional but also secure from common vulnerabilities, providing a reliable backend for the mobile application.
- **Interpreting User Needs**: The development process was guided by specific user requirements for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments. This helped in tailoring the services to precisely fit the customer's needs.
- **Approach to Software Design**: My design approach was systematic and modular, focusing on creating independent services that are easy to manage and update. This method supports better maintenance and scalability of the application.

### Future Applications

The skills and techniques developed through this project are invaluable for my future projects, especially those requiring rigorous testing and quality assurance. I plan to apply these principles to ensure that all software I develop is robust, user-friendly, and meets the exact needs of the users.

### Conclusion

This repository not only serves as a submission for CS 320 Project One but also as a demonstration of my ability to develop and test complex software systems. It showcases my commitment to creating high-quality, dependable software solutions.




**CS 320 Project Two: Advanced Testing and Reflections on Software Development**

This repository encompasses the detailed reports and reflections on the rigorous testing approaches and methodologies I implemented during Project Two of CS 320. This project provided a deep dive into unit testing and the broader testing strategies employed to ensure software reliability and functionality.

### Project Overview

In Project Two, I critically analyzed and documented the testing strategies for the mobile application backend services developed in Project One. This included the Contact, Task, and Appointment services, focusing on unit testing with JUnit to uncover errors and ensure compliance with the given specifications.

### Repository Contents

- **Project Summary and Reflections Report**: A comprehensive review of the unit testing approaches employed, including the alignment with software requirements, quality of tests, and the overall experience of writing JUnit tests. This document also explores the implications of the testing techniques used and not used, providing a reflective insight into the testing process.

### Key Learnings and Reflections

- **Effective Unit Testing**: Demonstrated through detailed JUnit tests for each service, ensuring each component functioned as expected and met all requirements. These tests provided a robust foundation for reliable software functionality.
  
- **Broader Testing Strategy**: Reflection on the non-employed techniques like Integration Testing and System Testing highlighted the potential areas for future improvement and the importance of comprehensive testing strategies across different stages of software development.

- **Testing Mindset and Quality Assurance**: Discussed the disciplined approach maintained throughout the project, ensuring high standards of quality and reducing bias through peer reviews and automated tools. This helped in identifying subtle bugs and potential failures, emphasizing the critical role of thorough testing in software development.

### Reflections on Software Development

- **Ensuring Functional and Secure Code**: My focus on rigorous unit testing and the consideration of additional testing strategies ensures that all software components are not only functional but also secure.
- **Interpreting User Needs and Software Design**: Reflections included how the testing processes align with user requirements and the overall software design approach, ensuring that the final product is user-centric and meets all expected functionalities.

### Future Applications

The experiences and methodologies from Project Two will inform my future projects, particularly in adopting a more integrated testing approach that includes unit, integration, and system testing to ensure comprehensive coverage and reliability.

### Conclusion

This repository serves as a detailed account of my advanced testing methodologies and reflections on the iterative process of software testing. It showcases my commitment to high-quality software development and my ability to critically analyze and enhance testing strategies.
